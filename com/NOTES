For the purposes of this application, the IP at which the server is hosted can change between runs.

We acknowledge that in a production environment, a dedicated static IP would be assigned for server/client communications,
however, due to the constraints of sharing over an open-source platform (GitHub), this is not a guaranteed setup for
all host machines.

If you've setup a static IP, you may modify the following line of code per the comment:

    |----------------------------------------------------------------
    | com/data.py
    |----------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | ...
    | class TCP:
    |       # IP = socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname())
    |       IP = '0.0.0.0' # Host on all IPs
    |       # Have a static IP ready for this server?
    |       # Host your server at that IP by modifying the above line as follows:
    |       # IP = '192.0.0.1'
    |       # Of course, change the IP to your static IP.
    |
    | ...
    |-----------------------------------------------------------------

To stop prompting client.py for the server IP, change the value in the following line from True to False

    |----------------------------------------------------------------
    | com/data.py
    |----------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | ...
    |
    |  # Should the client script prompt for an IP?
    |  _SRVC_CLT_POL_IP = True
    |
    | ...
    |-----------------------------------------------------------------
